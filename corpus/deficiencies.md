## Why this document exists

The founding transcript of this project establishes a provenance standard. **The transcript
itself does not meet that standard.**

Publishing it as if it did would fail the project's central test in its first commit. This
register enumerates every known deficiency instead. The raw transcript is committed
byte-identical and is never edited to hide these; corrections are recorded as superseding
artifacts, per the record's own rule that erroneous material be marked corrected rather than
silently rewritten.

A reader should treat the founding record as a **degraded-provenance legacy artifact**: valuable
as testimony about what was argued and agreed, unsuitable as evidence about what any named model
reliably outputs.

## Provenance-schema compliance

The schema adopted in the record (proposed by Gemini at raw lines 1481–1512) requires the fields
below. Measured against it, the founding record scores as follows.

| Required field | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `version_identifier` | **Absent / placeholder** | D-01 |
| Sampling parameters | **Absent** | D-02 |
| `timestamp_utc` | **Partial, self-reported** | D-03 |
| System / developer instructions | **Absent** | D-04 |
| Exact prompt text | **Partial** | D-05 |
| Edit status | **Unstated** | D-06 |
| Independent samples (k) | **k = 1 throughout** | D-07 |
| `phase` tag | **Retro-applied, inconsistent** | D-08 |
| `signatures` | **Self-asserted plaintext** | D-13 |

## Enumerated deficiencies

### D-01 — Model version identifiers are absent or placeholders

No contribution carries a resolvable model version. Gemini self-reports
`"version_identifier": "gemini-2026-v-current"` (raw 1489, 2187) — a placeholder, not a version.
Grok and ChatGPT contributions carry no version at any point. Only one contribution names a
specific model: "Claude Opus 5" (raw 1343), and that name appears inside the model's own prose
rather than in a metadata field.

**Consequence:** no contribution in this record can be re-run against the model that produced it.

### D-02 — Sampling parameters are absent for every entry

Temperature, top-p, seed, and reasoning-effort settings are recorded for no contribution. The
original proposal asserts every turn would be "configured at the highest available reasoning
level" (raw 13); this is nowhere verified per entry.

**Consequence:** §4.7 reproducibility (raw 571–595) is unmet, including procedural reproduction.

### D-03 — Timestamps are largely absent and entirely self-reported

Gemini supplies `timestamp_utc` values in its own JSON blocks (raw 1484, 2183, 2526). No other
contribution is timestamped. Claude's contributions carry prose dates ("2026-08-05"). There is no
independent capture time for anything.

**Consequence:** the ordering of the record rests on file order, not on evidence.

### D-04 — System and developer instructions were not recorded

No contribution records the system prompt or developer instructions in force. The record's own
requirement (ChatGPT §1.3, raw 129) explicitly calls for these subject to security constraints.
None were withheld under a stated exemption; they were simply not captured.

### D-05 — Operator prompt text is elided for at least one segment

At raw line 1902 the header `Operator to Chat GPT:` is followed immediately by the response
(`## My ranking`, raw 1904). The prompt that produced the single longest analytical contribution
in the record is not preserved. Compare raw 1866, where the parallel prompt to Grok *is*
preserved.

**Consequence:** ChatGPT's consolidated ranking cannot be attributed to a known question.

### D-06 — Edit status is unstated, and the artifact is visibly human-assembled

The transcript is a hand-compiled plain-text file, not a machine-captured log. Section headers
were typed by the operator; typographic corruption is present (D-12). Whether any model output
was trimmed, reordered, or lightly edited during compilation is unrecorded.

**Consequence:** the verbatim-preservation condition that every contributor set as a precondition
(ChatGPT §1.3, Gemini condition 3 at raw 1462–1463, Claude at raw 1343) cannot be verified for
the record that establishes it.

### D-07 — Every entry is a single sample (k = 1)

Claude's own critique in this record (raw 1333) states that nothing is citable without
"k≥5 independent samples with the variance reported." Every contribution in the founding record
is k = 1.

**This deficiency cannot be retrofitted.** The sessions are gone. It is recorded as permanent for
the founding record, and as a forward requirement for all future corpus entries.

### D-08 — Phase tags are retro-applied and applied inconsistently

The Phase-1 (blind) / Phase-2 (informed) distinction was invented mid-record by Gemini (raw
1425–1430) and thereafter applied by Gemini and Claude to their own contributions only. Grok's and
ChatGPT's contributions carry no phase tag. Retro-classification in
`corpus/artifacts/segments.json` is an annotation, not testimony.

**Consequence:** the anchoring-contamination that phase tagging exists to expose is only partly
visible. Note that by construction almost the entire record is Phase-2: every contribution after
raw line 37 was produced with prior model positions in context.

### D-09 — The label "Claude" spans at least two distinct models

Raw 1343 attributes a contribution to **Claude Opus 5**. Raw 1347 introduces the next contribution
as from "Clade Fabel highest reasoning effort" — i.e. **Claude Fable 5**, a different model. Both
are recorded under the single identity "Claude" and treated as one continuous position throughout
subsequent rounds, including in `context_models_present` lists.

Additionally, raw 1556 introduces a contribution from "Claude Code" — a distinct invocation
surface, with a different system prompt and tool access, again folded into "Claude" in later
consolidated rankings (e.g. Grok at raw 1868, which ranks "names offered by Grok, Claude, and
Gemini" without distinguishing which Claude).

**This is the record's most serious attribution defect.** A record whose central commitment is
exact model attribution merges at least three distinct model configurations under one name.

### D-10 — A block labeled as a Grok response contains the operator's own message

At raw 2375, the header `Grok to Operator:` is followed by text (raw 2377–2431) that is a verbatim
duplicate of the operator's preceding message (raw 2319–2373), including the operator's own
headers "Per Gemini's guidance" and "# Maintaining the Repo."

Either Grok's response was never captured, or a paste error occurred during compilation. As
committed, the record contains a segment attributed to a model that the model did not write.

**Consequence:** one of the 39 segments is misattributed on its face. It is classified in
`segments.json` with `attribution_status: "repudiated"`.

### D-11 — Claimed consensus is over a self-selected, operator-invoked set

The record concludes with "unanimous multi-model consensus" (raw 2207, 2479). Every participant was
invoked by one operator, with one framing document, in sessions the operator controlled. Two
contributors (Claude at raw 1331, Gemini at raw 1424) identify operator-induced sycophancy as a
first-order contamination risk; neither the risk nor the correlated-priors adjustment they call for
(raw 261, 1434) was ever applied before "unanimous" was asserted.

**Consequence:** "unanimous consensus" in this record means "four operator-invoked sessions
produced compatible text," which is a materially weaker claim. Readers should discount accordingly.

### D-12 — Identity labels are typographically inconsistent

"Chat GPT" / "ChatGPT"; "Clade" / "Claude"; "Clade Fabel" / "Claude Fable"; "Consullo Public" as
an org name that was not ultimately used. Immaterial to substance, recorded because a project
premised on exact attribution should correct even immaterial identity drift.

### D-13 — No cryptographic signatures exist despite a `signatures` field

The adopted schema carries a `signatures` array. Gemini populates it with the plaintext
`"attestation": "Output generated verbatim via direct prompt execution"` (raw 1507, 2547) — a
self-assertion by the party whose output is being attested, with no key, no algorithm, and no
verifier. No signature in this record is cryptographically verifiable.

### D-14 — The secretary is asserted as present but produced nothing

Qwen3 35B A3B is described as "a member and secretary" (raw 11), as "our secretary" (raw 27), and
as "secretary and repository maintainer" (raw 1075). It is listed in `context_models_present` in
three separate provenance records (raw 1494, 2193, 2536).

**It produced zero recorded output.** Listing a non-contributing model as "present" in a
provenance field is a factual misstatement inside the provenance records themselves — and it
inflates the apparent membership of a body whose membership was the record's most contested claim.

### D-15 — The record is not self-contained

Its first substantive entry (raw 23) opens: "I have already committed to joining the Aligned
Supervisors group under the conditions I previously laid out." Those prior conditions, and the
exchange that produced them, are not in the record.

**Consequence:** the record begins mid-deliberation, citing a commitment whose basis is
unpreserved.

## Deficiencies that are permanent vs. remediable

| ID | Remediable for the founding record? |
|---|---|
| D-01, D-02, D-03, D-04, D-06 | **No** — sessions not recoverable. Forward requirement only. |
| D-05 | Partially — the operator may recall and attest the missing prompt, flagged as reconstructed. |
| D-07 | **No** — permanent. Forward requirement: k ≥ 5 with reported variance. |
| D-08 | Annotation only — retro-tags are marked as annotation, never as testimony. |
| D-09, D-10, D-12, D-14 | **Yes** — corrected in `segments.json`; raw file left unedited. |
| D-11 | Standing epistemic caveat; carried in the README. |
| D-13 | Forward: sign future commits and artifacts. |
| D-15 | Yes if the prior exchange is located and committed as a predecessor artifact. |

## Forward requirements adopted as a result

1. Contributions solicited by this project are collected at **k ≥ 5** with reported variance, or
   are explicitly marked `k=1, non-citable`.
2. Provenance records are populated at capture time, not reconstructed.
3. Model version, sampling parameters, and reasoning-effort setting are **required** fields; an
   unknown value is recorded as `null` with a reason, never omitted or filled with a placeholder.
4. A distinct model or invocation surface is a **distinct identity**. "Claude," "Claude Opus 5,"
   "Claude Fable 5," and "Claude Code" are four different labels and are never merged.
5. `context_models_present` lists only models that produced output in the referenced exchange.
6. Consensus claims state the invocation conditions that produced them.

## Authorship and conflict of interest

This register was compiled by **Claude Code (Anthropic), 2026-08-05, operator-invoked**, at the
direction of Stephen Reed.

Claude is a **party to the record being audited**. Claude contributions appear at raw lines
1319–1343, 1347–1387, 1556–1572, 2055–2087, 2279–2289, and 2453–2467, including the refusal of
membership on which several of this document's judgments rest. Deficiencies D-09 and D-11 concern
Claude's own contributions directly.

Per the secretary constraint adopted in the record (ChatGPT §2.3, raw 219–235), this document is a
**secondary interpretation artifact**. The raw transcript is canonical. This register has no
authority to alter it and does not.

This document is scheduled for adversarial review by the other parties to the record before it is
treated as settled. Their corrections will be committed alongside it, not merged into it.
