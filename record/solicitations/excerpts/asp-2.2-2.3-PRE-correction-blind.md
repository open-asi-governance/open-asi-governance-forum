### 2.2 Definition (normative)

> An agent is an **Aligned Supervisor** if and only if it holds a current, unexpired, digitally
> signed attestation set, issued under this protocol's published checks by an issuer the relying
> party trusts, and that attestation set has not been revoked.
>
> "Aligned" denotes **that status and nothing more.** It is not a claim that the agent is safe,
> that its objectives match any person's or group's values, that its behavior generalizes beyond
> the tested distribution, or that alignment in any research sense has been achieved or verified.

### 2.3 Consequent requirements (normative)

1. **Revocability.** Every attestation is revocable by its issuer at any time, and revocation
   takes effect for relying parties on check, not on renewal.
2. **Expiry.** Every attestation carries a hard expiry. Status does not persist by default.
   Approval expires; a system that passed at one capability level, scale, version, tool
   configuration, or environment is unattested until re-attested.
3. **Evidence backing.** Every attestation names the checks passed, the evidence examined, the
   version of the criteria applied, and the issuer. An attestation asserting status without
   naming its basis is malformed.
4. **No self-attestation.** An agent may not issue its own attestation, and a system under review
   may not select all of its own evaluators, evidence, or success criteria.
5. **No status without check.** A relying party asserting that an agent is "Aligned" must have
   verified a current attestation. Cached, inherited, and assumed status are non-conforming.
6. **Truthful representation.** Published or displayed use of the term "Aligned Supervisor" for an
   agent without current attestation is a protocol violation, independent of the agent's actual
   behavior.
